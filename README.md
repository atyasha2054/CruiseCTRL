🚦 Intelligent Traffic Perception System

🌟 Overview

Our Intelligent Traffic Perception System is designed to revolutionize traffic monitoring, optimize road safety, and enhance real-time decision-making. By integrating object detection (YOLOv8), lane segmentation (UNet), and tracking (DeepSORT), our system provides actionable insights for smart cities. 🚗🛣️

🏎️ Features

1️⃣ Multi-Class Detection 🔍

🚗 🚶‍♂️ 🏍️ 🚌 🚦Utilizing YOLOv8, our system detects and classifies multiple road entities, including:

Cars

Pedestrians

Bikes

Buses

Traffic Signals

This enables real-time monitoring, ensuring better road safety and traffic management. 🏁

2️⃣ Lane Detection & Analysis 🛣️

Using advanced lane segmentation (UNet), our system identifies and tracks lane usage:

Detects lane boundaries 🏎️

Counts vehicles per lane 🚘

Analyzes traffic congestion patterns 📊

Example: On a 4-lane road, our system identifies how many vehicles are in each lane, optimizing road efficiency. 📍

3️⃣ Lane Segmentation & Context Awareness 🌍

Unlike simple lane detection, our detailed lane segmentation helps in:

Understanding intersections, merges, and roundabouts 🔄

Identifying vehicles drifting out of their lanes 🚨

Detecting illegal pedestrian crossings 🚶‍♂️❌

This ensures precise lane-based decision-making for improved safety. 🛑

4️⃣ Dynamic Route Optimization 🗺️

Our system analyzes real-time traffic data to recommend the shortest and safest routes:

Detects congestion & obstacles 🚦

Suggests alternate routes to avoid delays 🚗➡️

Improves overall travel efficiency 🏁

5️⃣ Real-Time Dashboard 📊🎛️

A Python-based dashboard provides live insights:
✅ Live Traffic Feeds 📹✅ Lane-Wise Vehicle Counts 🚗📊✅ Traffic Density Heatmaps 🔥✅ Lane Departure & Violation Alerts 🚨

🏆 Why Choose Our System? 🎯

✅ Comprehensive Detection: Tracks all road users with multi-class detection.✅ Advanced Lane Analysis: Segmentation & tracking provide deep traffic insights.✅ Dynamic Optimization: AI-powered route suggestions reduce congestion.✅ User-Friendly Dashboard: Real-time monitoring simplifies traffic management.
