# cruiseCTRL 🚗💨  

**cruiseCTRL** is an advanced multi-task learning framework designed for real-time perception in autonomous driving. It integrates object detection, lane segmentation, and tracking into a single end-to-end model, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for enhanced accuracy and robustness.

## 🚀 Key Features  

### 1. Multi-Task Learning  
- Combines **object detection (YOLOv8)**, **lane segmentation (UNet)**, and **tracking (DeepSORT)** into a unified model.  
- Improves **efficiency and context-awareness** for autonomous driving scenarios.  

### 2. Attention Mechanisms  
- Enhances **YOLOv8** with **Transformer-based attention modules**.  
- Boosts detection accuracy, especially for **small or occluded objects** in complex environments.  

### 3. Robustness Under Diverse Conditions  
- Implements **synthetic data augmentation** techniques (fog, rain, night conditions).  
- Ensures reliable performance across **varying lighting, weather, and traffic scenarios**.  

## 🛠️ Installation
