# 🚦 Intelligent Traffic Perception System 🚗🛣️

Welcome to our **Intelligent Traffic Perception System** – a cutting-edge solution designed to **revolutionize traffic management**, **enhance safety**, and **provide actionable insights** for smart cities! 🌍✨

---

## 🔍 Multi-Class Detection  
Our system leverages **YOLOv8** 🦾 to detect and classify multiple objects in real time, including:  
🚗 **Cars** | 🚶 **Pedestrians** | 🏍 **Bikes** | 🚌 **Buses** | 🚦 **Traffic Signals**  

This ensures **comprehensive traffic analysis**, enabling real-time monitoring of road activity and improving safety for all road users.  

---

## 🛣️ Lane Detection & Analysis  
Using advanced **lane segmentation (UNet)**, our system:  
✔️ **Identifies and analyzes lane boundaries**  
✔️ **Tracks vehicles moving through each lane** on roads with multiple lanes  
✔️ **Provides insights into traffic distribution & congestion patterns**  

This data is crucial for optimizing traffic flow and ensuring road safety! 🏎️💨  

---

## 🏁 Lane Segmentation  
Beyond basic lane detection, our system performs **detailed lane segmentation** to:  
🔹 Understand the **exact road layout** in complex scenarios like **intersections, merges, and roundabouts**  
🔹 **Integrate with object detection** to identify:  
   - 🚘 Vehicles **drifting out of lanes**  
   - 🚶 Pedestrians **crossing illegally**  

This **context-aware system** makes roads safer and traffic analysis more precise! 🚥⚠️  

---

## 🛤️ Dynamic Route Optimization  
🔄 **Real-time traffic data + lane occupancy analysis = Optimized Routes!**  
📍 In high-traffic conditions, our system:  
✅ Identifies the **shortest & most efficient routes** 🚗💨  
✅ Suggests **alternative paths** to reduce congestion 🚦  
✅ Improves travel efficiency and minimizes delays ⏳
